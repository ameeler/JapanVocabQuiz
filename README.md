# JapanVocabQuiz
A project meant to practice full stack development combining my interest in learning Japanese.

Current functionality: Displays word in Japanese. "Show" button shows the English translation. "Pass" and "Fail" buttons either pass the card if you got it correct or fail the card if you got it wrong.

Utizlizes AWS S3 for vocabulary word storage.

Can access the page through github pages: https://ameeler.github.io/JapanVocabQuiz
